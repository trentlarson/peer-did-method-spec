<h1>DIDComm Assumptions</h1>

<p>All DIDComm protocols share common assumptions about how communication happens, how security and privacy
guarantees are achieved, and how the duties of each participant are described and enforced. What follows here is a
summary; see the body of work in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/README.md">Hyperledger Aries</a>
for more information.

    <h2>Messages</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Peers interact via messages.</dt>
        <dd>This is a more general claim than saying that peers expose an API because it doesn't assume that peers
            are directly callable by each other. It must be possible to exchange DIDs in this method in a very
            asynchronous fashion (e.g., one party sends a message while the other party is offline; a response is
            returned when the original sender may not be actively listening).
        </dd>
        <dt>Message transmission is transport-agnostic.</dt>
        <dd>That is, the messages can flow over any combination of HTTP, Bluetooth, NFC, email, AMPRNet (TCP/IP over
            ham radio), snail mail, sneakernet, intermediaries, or future protocols we have not yet imagined.
        </dd>
        <dt>Messages are JSON ([[RFC8259]]).</dt>
        <dd>They are compatible with <a target="jsonld" href="https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#basic-concepts">
            basic concepts of [[JSON-LD]]</a>, but <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0047-json-ld-compatibility/README.md">
            no deep knowledge of JSON-LD is required to understand them, and no dependency
            on JSON-LD libraries is necessary</a>. The specifics of the JSON format are discussed below.
        </dd>
        <dt>Messages are serialized and encrypted in a standard way for transport.</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This method associates security guarantees with the message envelope rather than the transport, and is
                aligned philosophically with the approach of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/"
                        target="rfc">IETF's Message Level Security initiative</a>. However, the first version of this spec
                predates MLS's maturity, so the wire format uses JWEs ([[RFC7516]]) with
                <a href="https://github.com/openssi/peer-did-method-spec/issues/14#issuecomment-493626810"
                        target="_blank">some extensions</a>, instead. The extensions allow the same message to be
                encrypted once for multiple recipients and sent to them all in an efficient manner:

                <figcaption>Multiplexed encryption lets multiple parties decrypt.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>These extensions are under review by the maintainers of JWE/JWT and are likely to be mainstreamed
                eventually. The particulars are detailed in <a target="aries"
